   <p class= "bio"> My name is Suhmer Hyatt (insert cheesy joke, that I haven't already heard or made about my name here). I've wanted to be an illustrator since I was eight years old. Now here I am. Along the way, I also learned front-end web development. My portfolio is a living love letter to my evolution as a designer, as a person, and to all of the people who have walked beside me to get here. I like chocolate, baking, books, and music. I also love mugs. I've been told that I'm funny but I'm not entirely sure that I agree. Puns make me laugh harder than they should and I cry sometimes when I watch movies.I would like for you to come with me to my next destination; or at the very least, watch me do something great.</p>
